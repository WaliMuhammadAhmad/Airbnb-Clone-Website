# Airbnb Clone Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Clone Project repository! This project was developed during my second semester as an introduction to web development using Bootstrap. While it may not be a perfect replica of Airbnb's website, it marks a significant milestone in my learning journey.

## üëÄ Website Preview

## üè° About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a representation of my early foray into web development and design. It demonstrates my initial steps in using Bootstrap to create a web page that emulates the visual style of Airbnb. While it may lack the full functionality and complexity of the actual Airbnb platform, it serves as a testament to my growth and progress.

## üåà Features

- **Bootstrap Exploration:** This project was an exploration of Bootstrap's components and layout capabilities. I experimented with various Bootstrap classes to create a responsive and visually appealing interface.
- **Bootsrap Version:** I used Bootstrap v4.6x. You can use the latest version at the time avaliable.
- **Replica Elements:** While not an exact copy, the project showcases components and sections reminiscent of the Airbnb website, including navigation bars, property listings, and footers.
- **Learning Experience:** Every element in this project reflects my learning journey. Imperfections and shortcomings are embraced as opportunities for improvement.

## üôå Issues

The websit clone is not perfectly created. It was my first Bootstrap project so it may have some faults or errors. There could be some issue like "Could not load image" then don't worry beacuse i used the images from official airbnb website so it might me deleted. If you counter any other issues then kindly tell me, feel free to pull request!

## üöÄ Mission

My mission with this project is to highlight the importance of incremental progress and the value of beginner-level projects. It stands as a testament to my early efforts as a developer and emphasizes the significance of embracing challenges along the learning path.
